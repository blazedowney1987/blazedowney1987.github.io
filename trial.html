<h1>Beary Berry Honey</h1>
<p>Beary Berry Honey is a family operation, owned by Sam and Sandra Thiessen near Tofield, Alberta.Our Beekeeping farm has been in operation since 2004.
  <br>
  <br>In 2006 we decided to experiment with honey and fruit and started selling seven honey blends:  Strawberry,Cranberry,Blueberry,Red Raspberry,Black Raspberry and Cinnamon. 
</p>
<p>Our goal has always been to provide a high quality, local product that is all-natural. Everything we sell, we make by ourselves in our commercial kitchen on our farm with honey we harvest from the bees we raise. Every batch is hand crafted, bottled and labeled by our family for yours.

  Our family has worked very hard to make Beary Berry Honey one of the most well-known value-added honey producers in Alberta. Beary Berry Honey products can be found in our farm store, at farmersâ€™ markets in the Edmonton area, and in many Save On Foods stores and craft fairs across Alberta.</p>
